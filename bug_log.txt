    bug2：
        What: The screen split position is not correct
        Clue: see the VEG document for detail
        How: find "vertical end register" store the number of lines in one screen, since it's 400,
        we have to set the compare line field to （200-18）*(400/200)-1 rather than （200-18)-1
Version 3: musk finished
    bug1:
        What: the palyer cannot move after 1 second elapsed & segment fault
        Clue: use ssh and gdb to find that segment fault happens when we what to write data in blocks.S

        in file mazegame.c
